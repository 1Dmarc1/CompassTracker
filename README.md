# CompassTracker

**CompassTracker** is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that transforms compasses into player-tracking devices. Instead of pointing to the world spawn, compasses will direct players to the nearest player, adding excitement to survival games, manhunts, and other multiplayer scenarios.

## Features

- **Track Nearest Player:** Compasses dynamically point to the closest player.
- **Customizable Update Interval:** Adjust how frequently the compass updates its direction.
- **Tracked Player's name:** Press right click with the compass in the main hand to display the tracked player.
- **Cooldown System:** Set a cooldown period to prevent compass spamming.
- **Game Mode Filters:** Exclude players in Creative, Spectator, or Adventure modes from being tracked.
